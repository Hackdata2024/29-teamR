# Carbon eater âœ¨ 

- This is the detection part of the prototype phase carbon eater. 
- Humanity tries to achieve carbon neutrality by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, but unfortunately, every essential basic need whether going to grocery store or school, leaves behind a carbon footprint

- To make our earth a better place to live, we will utilize the knowledge of colloidal particles and the new advanced technology of machine learning and artificial intelligence to capture carbon emissions from the air.
